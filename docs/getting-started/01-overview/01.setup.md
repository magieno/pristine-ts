Setup
------

Alright, you are now ready to start your very first project using the Pristine Framework.

### Modules
Pristine is decomposed in Modules. Modules encapsulate specific functionality so you should really only include the modules for what you are trying to accomplish.

Some modules are mandatory though. You will learn more about modules in the [modules](05.modules.md) section of this chapter. For now, to make things easy, simply follow along and trust us.

### Installation
While Pristine isn't, this section is opiniated on specific conventions. Rest assured though, you can use your own conventions. However, to make things easy, we will be making suggestions to get you going faster.

#### Create a package.json
Start by creating a package.json file and copy the following content:

```
 {
  "name": "CHANGE_FOR_YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "main": "src/main.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "prebuild": "rm -rf dist",
    "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json",
    "start": "PRISTINE_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LOGGER_OUTPUT_MODE=SIMPLE ts-node ./src/express.ts"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@pristine-ts/common": "^0.0.140",
    "@pristine-ts/configuration": "^0.0.140",
    "@pristine-ts/core": "^0.0.140",
    "@pristine-ts/event": "^0.0.140",
    "@pristine-ts/express": "^0.0.140",
    "@pristine-ts/logging": "^0.0.140",
    "@pristine-ts/networking": "^0.0.140",
    "@pristine-ts/telemetry": "^0.0.140",
    "reflect-metadata": "^0.1.13",
    "tsyringe": "^4.6.0",
    "uuid": "^8.3.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^14.14.41",
    "ts-node": "^9.1.1",
    "typescript": "^4.2.4"
  }
}
```

#### Run the following command:

```
npm install
```

#### Create a tsconfig.json
Create a `tsconfig.json` file and paste the following content

```
 {
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "target": "es6",
    "module":"CommonJS",
    "lib": ["es2020"],
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "declaration": false,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "outDir": "dist/cjs",
    "typeRoots": [
      "node_modules/@types"
    ],
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": [
    "src"
  ],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}

```

#### Create your application module (entry point of your application)
Create a file named `src/app.module.ts` and put the following content:

```
import {CoreModule} from "@pristine-ts/core";

export const AppModule: AppModuleInterface = {
    importServices: [],
    importModules: [
     CoreModule,
    ],
    keyname: "my_namespace.app",
}
```

#### Create your main file
Create a file named `src/main.ts` and put the following content:

```
import {AppModule} from './app.module';
import {Kernel} from "@pristine-ts/core";

const bootstrap = async () => {
    const kernel = new Kernel();
    await kernel.init(AppModule);
}

bootstrap();
```

#### Wrapping up

That's it really, you now know how to initialize the Pristine Kernel. You could retrieve your services and have all the dependencies injected. (To learn how to retrieve your classes from the Container, see the [Dependency Injection](03.dependency-injection.md) chapter)
Now, you probably have a very important question:

> Ok, but how can I host it and server Http calls?

You will learn this in the next section: [Hosting](02.hosting.md)


### Real examples
Here are some Open Source projects that are using Pristine:
* [Pristine Starter](https://github.com/magieno/pristine-starter)
* [Pristine Business Intelligence Tool](https://github.com/magieno/pristine-business-intelligence-tool)
