Hosting / Execution
-------------------
The idea behind Pristine is that you decouple your business logic from how it is hosted. 

You can host Pristine under different contexts:
* Serverless
* Container
* On your local machine
* For scripting purposes 

### Scripting

If you look at the `scr/main.ts` file you created, we didn't tell you before, but this was the Scripting hosting. You can use the kernel directly to retrieve your classes from the Container and have their dependencies instantiated automatically. In certain contexts, you don't necessarily want to load an HTTP server, but you want to execute code and still benefit from all the features that Pristine provides. 

This is very useful and powerful. This means that you can write your business logic once and call your code under different mechanisms, from an HTTP call, from a Serverless world or from the command line.

### Function as a Service (Serverless)
In a Function as a Service world, the Cloud providers all have mechanisms to transform Http requests into binary objects, compatible with the runtime language, that can be used directly in the code without any further transformation. 

Unfortunately, most NodeJS frameworks are not built with a Serverless first mentality and can only handle Http requests by starting a Http Server. When you think about it for a second, it doesn't make sense. The Cloud provides you with a Request object, why not using it directly?
Starting another Http Server means that you are doing the same work twice.

This results in the following inefficient process:

<!-- todo put a real diagram -->
Http Client ---> Cloud --> Function Invocation (with Request object) --> Start local Http Server --> Convert request as Http Request --> Send to local Http Server --> Traditional NodeJS frameworks transform the Http Request into a Request object --> NodeJS frameworks handles the request.

Pristine doesn't work like that. Because it isn't coupled with any Http Server, Pristine expects its own Request format. This means that we only have to map the cloud's request object into pristine. This also means that we can easily map any Http Server's requests into a Pristine Request object. Mapping between two objects is always faster than starting a full-fledge Http Server.

Therefore, the process is much simpler:
Http Client ---> Cloud --> Function Invocation (with Request object) --> Cloud Specific Request Mapper --> Pristine

What's very interesting with Pristine, is that you don't incur a performance hit if you use a NodeJS Http Server either. The fact that Pristine is properly decoupled is very useful.

#### AWS Lambda

In the Lambda world, you have two different flows, the Request flow (from API Gateway) that expects a response and the Event flow (all the Lambda triggers). Pristine allows you to reuse code by supporting those two flows out of the box.
