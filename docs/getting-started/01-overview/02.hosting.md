# Hosting / Execution

In this section, we'll explore the different ways that Pristine can be hosted.

You can host Pristine under different contexts:
* Function as a Service (Serverless)
* NodeJS Server (Container, Virtual machine or your local machine)
* For scripting purposes by running it directly via the command line

## Function as a Service (Serverless)

### AWS Lambda
In the Lambda world, you have two different flows, the Request flow (from API Gateway) that expects a response and the 
Event flow (all the Lambda triggers). Pristine allows you to reuse code by supporting those two flows out of the box. In
the context of a Request, you have to return a response. In the context of an Event, you don't **NEED** to return a response.
(If you are using Kafka, you probably want to acknowledge that you have processed a message so Pristine supports 
responding to events).

Since we can handle both Lambda flows at once, we will do just that.

1- Install the `aws-lambda` and `@pristine-ts/aws`node packages

2- Create a file named `src/lambda.ts` and include the following code:

```
import "reflect-metadata";
import {AppModule} from './app.module';
import {ExecutionContextKeynameEnum, Kernel} from "@pristine-ts/core";
import {Context} from "aws-lambda";
import {AwsModule, RequestMapper, ResponseMapper} from "@pristine-ts/aws";
import {EnvironmentVariableResolver} from "@pristine-ts/configuration";

let cachedKernel;

export const bootstrapKernel = async () => {
    const kernel = new Kernel();
    
    // This line adds the AwsModule created by pristine. This ensures that you can easily host the same code
    // for different platform without bundling useless dependencies
    AppModule.importModules.push(AwsModule);
    
    await kernel.start(AppModule,
        {
            [AwsModule.keyname + ".region"] : 'us-east-1',
        }
    );

    return kernel;
};

export const handler = async (event: any, context: Context) => {
    cachedKernel = cachedKernel ?? await bootstrapKernel();

    return cachedKernel.handle(event, {keyname: ExecutionContextKeynameEnum.AwsLambda, context});
};

```

That's it! If you run `npm run build`, you can upload all your files to AWS S3 and use the compiled `lambda.js` file as
the handler of your Lambda function. We have a step-by-step guide on how to get you started on AWS Lambda. In this, you
will learn how to set up rollup and automated your deployment to AWS. [AWS Lambda Guide](../../guides/aws/aws-lambda/00.index.md)

## NodeJS Server

### Express
If you want to use Express, you will need to install the ExpressModule via npm: `@pristine/express`.

Then, you will need to create a file named `src/express.ts` with the following content:

```
import "reflect-metadata";
import {ExpressModule} from "@pristine-ts/express";
import {ExecutionContextKeynameEnum, Kernel} from "@pristine-ts/core";
import {AppModule} from "./app.module";

const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000 // <-- Configure your PORT here
const kernel: Kernel = new Kernel();

const bootstrap = () => {
    AppModule.importModules.push(ExpressModule);

    app.all('*', async (req, res) => {
        await kernel.handle(req, {keyname: ExecutionContextKeynameEnum.Express, context: {req, res}});
    })

    app.listen(port, async () => {
        await kernel.start(appModuleWithExpress);

        console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
    })
}

bootstrap();
```

Then, you can start your Pristine setup hosted under express by running the command:
`ts-node ./src/express.ts`


## Scripting

If you look at the `scr/main.ts` file you created in the previous section, we didn't tell you before, but this was the 
Scripting hosting. You can use the kernel directly to retrieve your classes from the Container and have their 
dependencies instantiated automatically.

In certain contexts, you don't necessarily want to load an HTTP server, but you want to execute code and still benefit
from all the features that Pristine provides. 

Simply access the `container` property from the kernel, resolve your service, and use it!

```
import {AppModule} from './app.module';
import {Kernel} from "@pristine-ts/core";

const bootstrap = async () => {
    const kernel = new Kernel();
    await kernel.start(AppModule);
    
    // Access your services like this:
    const myService = kernel.container.resolve(MyService);
}

bootstrap();
```
