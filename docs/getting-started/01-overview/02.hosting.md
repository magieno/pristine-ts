Hosting
-------

You can host Pristine under different contexts:
* Serverless
* Container
* On your local machine
* For scripting purposes 

### Scripting

If you look at the `scr/main.ts` file you created, we didn't tell you before, but this was the Scripting hosting. You can use the kernel directly to retrieve your classes from the Container and have their dependencies instantiated automatically. In certain contexts, you don't necessarily want to load an HTTP server, but you want to execute code and still benefit from all the features that Pristine provides. 

This is very useful and powerful. This means that you can write your business logic once and call your code under different mechanisms, from an HTTP call, from a Serverless world or from the command line.

### Serverless (AWS Lambda)
In the Lambda world, you have two different flows, the Request flow (from API Gateway) that expects a response and the Event flow (all the Lambda triggers). Pristine allows you to reuse code by supporting those two flows out of the box.  

### Http Server
