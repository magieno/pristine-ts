<!--
First, explain why dependency injection, why even in NodeJS it's important.

Talk about how we need to add the @injectable (refer to tsyringe documentation).

Talk about how they need to ensure that their classes are registered in their module and why
    - Because if they are never imported, the decorators do not get called (since decorators are transformed into functions that get called at runtime), so the classes are never seen.

Talk about the @tag and @moduleScoped decorators and how great they are.
