# Decorators

Decorators (also called annotations in other languages) are an integral part of Pristine (i.e. we use decorators almost everywhere). If you are not familiar with decorators, I encourage you to read on them and their particularities in TypeScript: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html]()

## Enable decorators support in tsconfig.json
Decorators are still considered "experimental" since they are not directly supported in Javascript. So, you must activate the feature in the `tsconfig.json` file like this:

```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        // ...
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
        // ...
    }
}
```
