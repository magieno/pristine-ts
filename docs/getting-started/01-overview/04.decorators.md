# Decorators

Decorators (also called annotations in other languages) are an integral part of Pristine (i.e. we use decorators almost
everywhere). If you are not familiar with decorators, I encourage you to read on them and their particularities in 
TypeScript: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html]()

## Enable decorators support in tsconfig.json
Decorators are still considered "experimental" since they are not directly supported in Javascript. So, you must 
activate the feature in the `tsconfig.json` file like this:

```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        // ...
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
        // ...
    }
}
```

Once this is done, you will be able to use Pristine and the decorators. If you copied the `tsconfig.json` file in the 
[Setup](01.setup.md) section, you will see it contains these two lines.

The behaviour of the decorators is outside of the scope of this tutorial. Simply be familiar enough with them since you
will use them.
