Modules
-------

Modules are a great way to structure your code such that you can bundle together code that serve a similar purpose. The Pristine framework follows this approach and as you can see, the code is decomposed in different modules. This brings better readibility, better decoupling but most importantly, it keeps everything light. This allows us to lower the number of dependencies for projects that don't require all the features. You can simply import the modules you need and only the absolutely required dependencies will be installed.


## How to create your own module
todo: explain this section.

## Official Pristine Modules
This section presents all the modules and gives brief information about what they contain.

The driving force behind Pristine is this idea that we are making the developers' lives easier. We will create a lot of modules that makes it very easy to integrate with different proprietary software.
