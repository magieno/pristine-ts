Modules
-------

Modules are a great way to structure your code such that you can bundle together code that serve a similar purpose. The
Pristine framework follows this approach and as you can see, the code is decomposed in different modules. This brings 
better readability, better decoupling but most importantly, it keeps everything light. This allows us to lower the 
number of dependencies for projects that don't require all the features. You can simply import the modules you need and
only the absolutely required dependencies will be installed.

## How to create your own module
Creating your own module is easy. You create a file where all your code will be exported. This is the entrypoint of your
module. Our naming convention is `module-name.module.ts`. However, use whatever you want, it doesn't matter. 
Then, you need to export a variable like this: 

```
export const YourModuleModule: ModuleInterface = {
    keyname: "your.module.name",
    importModules: [
        CoreModule,
        NetworkingModule,
    ]
}
```

This is a very basic module that does nothing. Every module must have a unique keyname. It's convention to prefix it with something unique
to your project (could be your company name).

After, if your services depend on classes in other modules, you need to tell Pristine to import those modules first. You
do so using the `importModules` (the order of the imports do not matter.)

Alright, so that's a module. It's a very simple one. If you are curious, I encourage you to explore the other 
properties available for you module in `ModuleInterface`.

That being said, Modules are very powerful and there are a lot more features you can use that are not explained here.
This page only goes through the basics. We do a deeper dive on modules in the 
[Modules chapter](docs/getting-started/05-modules/00.index.md)

## Official Pristine Modules
Here's a list of all the Official Pristine Modules. We create a lot of official modules to make the developers' lives
easier. If you don't see a module that you would like, either contribute or ask us for it and we'll create it.
