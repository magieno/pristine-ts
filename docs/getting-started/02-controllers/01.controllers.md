Controllers
-------

In order to make it easy to handle Http Requests in your code, Pristine uses classes annotated with the `@controller` decorator. This tells Pristine
that this class will 

Pristine will map the methods to different HTTP Endpoints and will route the requests to the appropriately decorated method.

Here's an example, let's create a file at `src/controllers/api.controller.ts`:
```
import {injectable} from "tsyringe";
import {controller, route} from "@pristine-ts/networking";
import {HttpMethod} from "@pristine-ts/common";

@controller()
@injectable()
class ApiController {
    @route(HttpMethod.Get, "/api")  
    public get() {
        return "This method was reached at 'GET /api'";
    }
}
```

make sure you also add this controller to your AppModule (`src/app.module.ts`) like this:
```
import {CoreModule} from "@pristine-ts/core";
import {ApiController} from "controllers/api.controller"

export const AppModule: AppModuleInterface = {
    importServices: [
        ApiController, // <-- Import this Controller
    ],
    importModules: [
        CoreModule,
    ],
    keyname: "my_namespace.app",
}
```


If you make an HTTP call with method `GET` at `/api`, your method will be invoked and the HTTP response will be 
> This method was reached at 'GET /api'
 
As you can imagine, this controller must be registered in the Container hence why you are seeing the `@injectable` decorator.

**In the section [decorators](04.decorators.md), you will learn about all the different decorators supported inside a Controller**

That's it, you have created your first Controller!
