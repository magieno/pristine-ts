Request
-------

As mentioned in the previous sections, Pristine encapsulates its own Request object. This makes Pristine very extensible and makes it virtually compatible
with any Http Server as long as you map the Http Request into a valid Pristine Request.

Pristine expects to receive an object that implements the `RequestInterface`. The `RequestInterface` can be located at
[../../packages/common/src/interfaces/request.interface.ts](../../packages/common/src/interfaces/request.interface.ts)

It's a very simple interface.

The entrypoint of a Pristine project is always the kernel. Hence, if you have followed since the tutorial, you know how to instantiate the kernel. 
If you look at the methods on the Kernel, you will see the `handleRequest` method. This method expects an argument of type `RequestInterface`.

It should start to make sense to you now how you could easily integrate with any Http Server by simply converting the HttpRequest into a `RequestInterface` and passing that converted object to Pristine.
You will see in the next section how to handle the Response object, since you will need to do a reverse mapping between the Pristine Response and the Http Server's response.

Looking at the code, we can see that integrating with Express, is as simple as doing:

```
import "reflect-metadata";
import {RequestMapper, ResponseMapper} from "@pristine-ts/express";
import {Kernel} from "@pristine-ts/core";
import {AppModule} from "./app.module";

const express = require('express')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
const app = express()
app.use(bodyParser.json({ type: 'application/json' }))
const port = 80 // <-- Configure your port
const kernel = new Kernel();

const bootstrap = () => {
    app.all('*', async (req, res) => {
        const expressRequestMapper = kernel.container.resolve(RequestMapper);
        const expressResponseMapper = kernel.container.resolve(ResponseMapper);

        expressResponseMapper.reverseMap(await kernel.handleRequest(expressRequestMapper.map(req)), res);
    })

    app.listen(port, async () => {
        await kernel.init(AppModule);
    })
}

bootstrap();
```

If you are curious, here's the code inside the `RequestMapper` in the `Express` Module (this can provide a great example of how to map your own request):

**[modules/express/src/mappers/request.mapper.ts](modules/express/src/mappers/request.mapper.ts)**

```
@injectable()
export class RequestMapper {
    constructor(private readonly httpHeadersMapper: HttpHeadersMapper,
                private readonly methodMapper: MethodMapper,
                private readonly bodyMapper: BodyMapper) {
    }

    /**
     * Maps an http request from express to a Pristine request.
     * @param request The http request from express.
     */
    map(request: Request): RequestInterface {
        return {
            url: request.url,
            headers: this.httpHeadersMapper.map(request.headers),
            httpMethod: this.methodMapper.map(request.method),
            body: this.bodyMapper.map(request.body),
            rawBody: request.body,
        }
    }
}
```


It cannot be simpler. And as you can see, we can also use Dependency Injection ensuring that we can properly unit tests different scenarios without actually starting an Express server.
