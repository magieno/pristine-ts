Decorators
-------

Pristine uses a lot of decorators to augment the functionalities of a controller. In this section, we will list all the decorators available and how they can be used.

## `@body`
The `@body` can be put on a method argument to receive the content of the HTTP Request Body as a parameter. This decorator allows you to do:

```
import {injectable} from "tsyringe";
import {controller, route, body} from "@pristine-ts/networking";
import {HttpMethod} from "@pristine-ts/common";

@controller()
@injectable()
class ApiController {
    @route(HttpMethod.Post, "/api")  
    public createNewDocument(@body body: any) {
        return "This method sent the following body: '" + JSON.stringify(body) + "'";
    }
}
```


## `@controller`
The `@controller` decorator is put on a class to inform Pristine that this class will be used as a [Controller](00.index.md). This means that this class will handle http requests.

`@controller` cannot be used on its own. You need the `@route` decorator for each method to specify what method will be called for each endpoint.

### Define a base path
The decorator accepts a base path for the whole class. This means that if you put a bas path, you won't need to type the whole path in the `@route` decorator. 
You'll only specify the part after the base path defined for the whole controller.

Here's an example:
```
@controller("/api")
@injectable()
class ApiController {
    @route(HttpMethod.Post, "/")  
    public createNewDocument(@body body: any) {
        return "This method sent the following body: '" + JSON.stringify(body) + "'";
    }
}
```

## `@headers`

## `@identity`

## `@queryParameter`

## `@queryParameters`

## `@request`

## `@responseHeader`

## `@route`

## `@routeParameter`

## `@bodyValidation`
For this decorator, you will need the `@pristine-ts/validation` module. This adds a dependency to these npm packages: 
```
class-transformer,
class-validator,
```

which in turn only add 2 additional dependencies:

```
libphonenumber-js,
validator,
```

These libraries are very complete, add huge benefits and are very lightweight. Hence, 

**It is our objective to keep the number of external dependencies as low as possible. When we include dependencies, we try to be as transparent as possible.**
