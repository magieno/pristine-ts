Decorators
-------

Pristine uses a lot of decorators to augment the functionalities of a controller. In this section, we will list all the decorators available and how they can be used.

## `@body`
The `@body` can be put on a method argument to receive the content of the HTTP Request Body as a parameter. This decorator allows you to do:

```
import {injectable} from "tsyringe";
import {controller, route, body} from "@pristine-ts/networking";
import {HttpMethod} from "@pristine-ts/common";

@controller()
@injectable()
class ApiController {
    @route(HttpMethod.Post, "/api")  
    public createNewDocument(@body body: any) {
        return "This method sent the following body: '" + JSON.stringify(body) + "'";
    }
}
```

### How do you know the object is a JSON object?
This depends on the request mapper you are using and how you are hosting your Pristine project. For example, if you are using the Express module, in the body-mapper we created, here's the code:




## `@controller`

## `@headers`

## `@identity`

## `@queryParameter`

## `@queryParameters`

## `@request`

## `@responseHeader`

## `@route`

## `@routeParameter`

## `@bodyValidation`
For this decorator, you will need the `@pristine-ts/validation` module. This adds a dependency to these npm packages: 
```
class-transformer,
class-validator,
```

which in their turns add only 2 additional dependencies:

```
libphonenumber-js,
validator,
```

These libraries are very complete, add huge benefits and are very lightweight. Hence, 

**It is our objective to keep the number of external dependencies as low as possible. When we include dependencies, we try to be as transparent as possible.**
