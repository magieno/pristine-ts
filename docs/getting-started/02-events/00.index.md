Events
-------

Events are at the core of Pristine. We haven't made a lot of allusion to it yet, but the only thing that Pristine 
actually does, is handle events and response to those events. That's what Pristine does.

**Really?**

Yes! If you dive into the Kernel's code, you will see that once it's instantiated, everything is treated as an Event.

Therefore, it's important to understand the lifecyle of the Events in Pristine. You can manipulate the entire flow of an
event and intervene whenever you want.
