Event Mapper
-------

The **Event Mapper** is a crucial component in the Pristine architecture. Its responsibility is simple yet vital: **Translation**.

In a serverless world, your application can be triggered by a multitude of sources:
* An HTTP Request (API Gateway, ALB)
* A Queue Message (SQS, Kafka)
* A Database Stream (DynamoDB Streams)
* A Scheduled Event (EventBridge)
* A CLI Command

Each of these sources provides a payload in a completely different format. The **Event Mapper** takes this raw payload and converts it into a standardized, internal `Event` object that Pristine understands.

This decoupling allows your core business logic (the [Event Handler](03.event-handler.md)) to remain agnostic of the trigger source. Your handler doesn't care if the request came from AWS API Gateway or an Azure Function; it just cares about the `Event`.

### How it works

1.  The `Kernel` receives a raw request.
2.  It iterates through registered `EventMappers`.
3.  The first Mapper that supports the event type transforms it.
4.  The pipeline continues with the standardized `Event`.

### Implementing a Custom Mapper

You rarely need to implement your own mapper unless you are integrating a new platform or a custom event source. Most standard integrations (AWS, HTTP, etc.) are provided by `@pristine-ts` packages.
